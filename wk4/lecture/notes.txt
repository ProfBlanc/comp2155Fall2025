inheritance
    creating a class BASED on another

    old class           new class
    parent              child
    super               sub
    base                derived


    no entities (attributes, actions) can be removed from the new class
    actions can be overridden
        why? to update its behaviour to be more specific, to reflect newer class attributes

another reason to use inheritance is to GROUP similar entities together
